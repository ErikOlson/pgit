If commands like 'status' have the normal git passthrough to product and the '-p' process versions, that could be confusing that 'add' adds all and doesn't have the passthrough and '-p' version distinction...



Consider anything we want to add to pnp:
pnp add . makes sense if we have the pnp commit -m
also, add a pnp push then
